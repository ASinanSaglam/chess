###Chess Engine/AI 

This is a chess Engine/AI project that is written solely for educational
purposes. Don't expect it to work properly.

Our work is currently in progress and the program is unusable as is.

If you must contact us check out our info in the source code.

TODO:

1) Save/load and output in various standard formats 

2) Some basic menu functionality in place, need a more robust system 

3) Referee needs to be finished and debugged (most work needed here)

4) AI hook complete, player/input system done (need to rewrite at somepoint but...)
now we can implement an AI right after Referee is complete.
