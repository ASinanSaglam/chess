###Chess Engine/AI 

This is a chess Engine/AI project that is written solely for educational
purposes. Don't expect it to work properly.

Our work is currently in progress and the program is unusable as is.

If you must contact us check out our info in the source code.

TODO:

1) Save/load and output in various standard formats 

2) Menus! Single player, multi player and settings menus

3) Hook for future AI 

4) Referee needs to be finished and debugged (most work needed here)

5) Once all in place, start the AI
