###Chess Engine/AI 

This is a chess Engine/AI project that is written solely for educational
purposes. Don't expect it to work properly.

Our work is currently in progress and the program is unusable as is.

If you must contact us check out our info in the source code.

TODO:

1) Save/load and output in various standard formats 

2) Referee somewhat done, some more types of move checking still need to be 
implemented, namely: castling, en passant.

3) Random AI implemented, more rewrites to random places will end up being
needed almost surely. Now onto actual AI tests? Like very basic tree search
with a simple scoring function?

4) Game state checking need to be added, in check, three-fold-repetition,
win/lose, stalemate etc.

5) Added basic tab completion but the completer is unaware of the current
menu. Will need tweaking in the future. At some point will need to rethink 
how menus actually work.
